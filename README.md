Computing Security capstone project, fall 2019. Power analysis attacks.

[aes-capture](./aes-capture/README.md)
--------------------------------------

This section can be used to capture power traces of AES-128 encryption operations. Use it to capture the traces needed for the CPA and DPA attacks.

[cpa-attack](./cpa-attack/README.md)
------------------------------------

This section can be used to perform correlation power analysis attacks against AES-128.

[dpa-attack](./dpa-attack/README.md)
------------------------------------

This section can be used to perform differential power analysis (difference of means) attacks against AES-128.

[rsa-demo](./rsa-demo/README.md)
--------------------------------

This section is a demonstration of simple power analysis using RSA.
